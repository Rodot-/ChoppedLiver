# Each element of the list should adhere to the following format
#
# Date: ISO %Y%m%d # Required, date of entry, dates may repeat, this represents the start of an entry, must be first item
# Status: ISO %Y%m%d/Incomplete/None # Required, status of the sub entry (None for ambiguous or general reminders, date for date of completion)
# By: ISO %Y%m%d/None # optional, date that activity needs to be completed by, may be used multiple times
# User: Name # Required, name of person making the entry, may be used multiple times
# Descriptions of things to do, no strict requirements

Create an overleaf document to keep track of parameter changes with ISIS
Status: Incomplete
Determine good logging methods for changes to ISIS subtract runs
Create a directory somewhere containing resources such as pdfs, links, etc
	Having a perminant reference to these resources will be helpful for keeping us all on the same page
Determine PSF fits to LiverPool images to get better estiamtes of gaussian widths in ISIS
test run_clean for use with arbitrary file lists
	also add in some assertions to make sure files exist, etc
	and maybe change the name to run_prep instead since run_clean might be confusing with radio data
